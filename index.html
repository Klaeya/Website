    <p class = 'A' >[1] <b>Fourscore </b> and <b>seven years ago </b> our fathers brought forth on this continent, 
        a new nation, conceived in <i>Liberty</i>, and dedicated to the proposition that all 
        men are created equal. [2] Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing 
        whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long 
        endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to 
        dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here 
        gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and 
        proper that we should do this.[3] But, in a larger sense, we can not 
        dedicate-we can not consecrate-we can not hallow-this ground. The brave men, 
        living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor 
        power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we 
        say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, 
        rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here 
        have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the 
        great task remaining before us-that from these honored dead we take increased 
        devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion-that
         we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain-that this 
         nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom-and that government of the 
         people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.</p>
